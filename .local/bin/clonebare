# This script is made to fix the problem with the bare repos with worktrees
# Like when you create the bare repo in the config bare = true then the fetch
# option is assigned with `+refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*` which is fuc*ing bad because
# you can't performe some actions (like --force-with-lease) and which fetch the
# refs/head will be updated...
# REFERENCE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54367011/git-bare-repositories-worktrees-and-tracking-branches

# So this script just clone the repo with bare and adjust the fetch option and sync the repo

# The question is: why use bare repo?
# I'm use bare repo because i need to work with many modifications in the same time and worktree works better than
# the standart checkout, and i use bare specific because my jump plugins in emacs uses the bare struct to parse the
# files.
